Purkey", "“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”―Mahatma Gandhi", "“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”―Mahatma Gandhi", "“Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.”―Martin Luther King Jr.,A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches", "“Without music, life would be a mistake.”―Friedrich Nietzsche,Twilight of the Idols", "“We accept the love we think we deserve.”―Stephen Chbosky,The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "“Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.”―Marilyn Monroe", "“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”―Albert Einstein", "“We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.”―Oscar Wilde,Lady Windermere's Fan", "“Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.”―Neil Gaiman,Coraline", "“Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift of God, which is why we call it the present.”―Bill Keane", "“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”―Thomas A. Edison", "“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.”―Elie Wiesel", "“I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”―Albert Einstein", "“You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...”―Dr. Seuss,Oh, the Places You'll Go!", "“It is never too late to be what you might have been.”―George Eliot", "“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”―Marilyn Monroe", "“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.”―Maya Angelou,I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", "“Everything you can imagine is real.”―Pablo Picasso", "“You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.”―C.S.

Anything can be.”―Shel Silverstein", "“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”―Winston S. Churchill", "“When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.”―Helen Keller", "“So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.”―Stephen Chbosky,The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”―Paulo Coelho,The Alchemist", "“You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us. And the world will live as one.”―John Lennon", "“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”―Frank Herbert,Dune", "“Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice.
